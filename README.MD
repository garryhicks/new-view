# New-View

This app is still early, but it uses the Instagram API to retrieve the most recent popular tagged images from Instagram. The app takes a string, uses the string to make a call to Instagram, and returns the 20 (default) most recent related results, formatted into a div containing an anchor tag.

Future ideas include: searching a user's profile, user's most recent and/or liked pictures, and integrating with the Google Maps API to return 20 (subsequently more) results and display them on a map, according to where the pictures were geographically posted from.

Enjoy!
